              I'm 21 and enthusiastic about tech. As a child, I fell head over
              heels for playing games it was an amazing escape! But eventually,
              my love for games transformed into a love for code. As I grew
              older, I discovered that my fulfillment came from making progress
              in myself rather than in a virtual world. Coding became my new
              source of relaxation and accomplishment, offering me equal
              measures of joy and a sense of achievement.

            <p className="font-thin text-md leading-7 mx-1">
              Given my passion for coding and the significant time I dedicate to
              it, I highly value opportunities to engage with the world beyond
              my screen. Spending quality time outdoors with my friends and
              girlfriend is truly delightful. I genuinely enjoy embarking on
              exciting journeys, discovering new places, meeting intriguing
              people, and crafting cherished memories. These experiences bring a
              much-needed balance to the solitary nature of coding, infusing my
              life with vibrancy, joy, and meaningful connections.
